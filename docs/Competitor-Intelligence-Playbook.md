This playbook documents the best practices and workflows for building a Real-Time Competitor Strategy Tracker.

1. Overview
   Step-by-step guide for ingesting, processing, modeling, and visualizing competitor pricing and sentiment data.

2. Data Ingestion
   Tools: Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup
   Best Practices:

* Use rate limiting and retry logic to respect target sites.
* Structure scrapers by competitor and data type (e.g., pricing, reviews).
  Example Snippet:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def fetch\_prices(url):
response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
prices = \[tag.text for tag in soup.select('.price')]
return prices

3. Data Preprocessing
   Libraries: pandas, numpy
   Steps:

* Normalize price formats (e.g., remove currency symbols)
* Handle missing values (drop or impute)
* Timestamp alignment for time-series

4. Forecasting with ARIMA
   Library: statsmodels
   Workflow:

* Check stationarity (ADF test)
* Identify order (p,d,q) via ACF/PACF plots
* Fit model and validate on hold-out set
  Example Snippet:

from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

model = ARIMA(series, order=(2,1,2))
result = model.fit()
forecast = result.forecast(steps=10)

5. Sentiment Analysis
   Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, Groq API
   Steps:

* Load pre-trained sentiment model
* Tokenize and predict sentiment scores
* Aggregate scores over time

6. Dashboard and Visualization
   Framework: Streamlit, Plotly
   Features:

* Dynamic charts for price trends and sentiment over time
* Interactive what-if scenario controls
  Deployment:
  Use streamlit run app.py and automate with GitHub Actions

7. CI/CD and Version Control
   Platform: GitHub Actions
   Best Practices:

* Automate linting and tests on pull requests
* Use semantic commits and tagging for releases
