Days Gone | PS4 Game (PlayStation 4),"‚Çπ1,817.00",,"Expansive open world action - exemplifying truly free-form gameplay, days gone offers freedom to explore, strategize and play ""your way"" in the vast high-desert of the pacific northwest; The hazardous environments, filled with carved out ridges, mountains, caves, cliffs mines and river basins, deliver a breath-taking backdrop to an equally diverse style of gameplay",4.5 out of 5 stars,"2,873 ratings","What do I say. I watched some of its videos online and wanted to play it but it's reviews suggested otherwise. I knew already that reviews don't matter so based on my own decision bought this game....and ohh my god what a brilliant game. I put down Red dead 2 just to play days gone. After approx 50 to 60 hours I am towards the end of the game and I enjoyed it like hell.Pros:1. Excellent gameplay loop. I don't know what it is but I enjoy doing even simple tastks in the game which I do not in other games like Assassin's creed.2. Hordes. Man hordes are heart of this game. This gives some truely genuine scares out in open world. I have never been so afraid to venture out in dark in this game compared to other games. Man the freakers are ferocious.3. The narrative story to die for. I won't delve much into the story as it may be spoiler for others...but damn this is Witcher, red dead 2 level of story telling.4. Stealth and combat. Stealth is thoughtful and not dumb like Assassin's creed. Gunplay is weighty and flawless.Cons:1. Not enough customisation. I would like more customisation of Deacon's clothes, his bike and most importantly his guns. Guns are pretty much bare bones. If you don't like the gun just purchase another one coz you can't upgrade anyone of them except extended magazine. That not to say combat is bad. Combat is really good and gunplay mechanics are flawless.2. Some really nasty bugs. I encountered two bugs in my full playtime that crashed my game totally. There were other minor bugs that caused items to disappear or NPC to be non responsive.3. Frame rate issues on base ps4 slim consoles specially inside the camps. But not enough to stop enjoying the game. Frame rates out in the open world and during combat remains solid 30fps.P.S: After the update almost the bugs have been ironed out.Verdict: Think no further, Just buy this god damn game and enjoy.
